# Resume and Portfolio Skills Summary

## Project Summary (Portfolio)
RelayDocs is a production-style collaborative document platform demonstrating full-stack architecture with a React/TypeScript frontend, Node.js API gateway, Spring Boot microservice, PostgreSQL data layer, and Kafka-based event processing. The platform emphasizes deterministic behavior, strict validation boundaries, server-enforced RBAC, and CI-gated delivery quality.

## Full-Stack Software Development Skills
- Architected and delivered a multi-service platform using React, TypeScript, Node.js, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Kafka.
- Implemented strict API validation with Zod and Bean Validation to enforce schema-safe request handling.
- Designed server-enforced RBAC and permission propagation flows across gateway and service boundaries.
- Built CI quality gates across linting, build verification, unit/integration tests, and E2E tests.
- Improved reliability with idempotent consumer patterns and replay-safe event handling.

## AI Engineering Skills (Applied)
- Used AI-assisted coding workflows to accelerate implementation while preserving strict typing and validation constraints.
- Applied AI support for test generation, defect triage, and risk-focused code review.
- Maintained structured decision logs and checkpoint-driven execution for continuity and traceability.
- Converted broad product goals into scoped implementation plans with measurable delivery checkpoints.
- Used AI collaboration with CI-first guardrails (small diffs, regression checks, explicit tradeoff tracking).

## Resume Bullets (Copy-Ready)
- Built and deployed a collaborative document platform using React, TypeScript, Node.js, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Kafka with server-enforced RBAC and strict API validation.
- Implemented deterministic, CI-gated delivery with automated lint/build/unit/integration/E2E checks to reduce regression risk.
- Designed idempotent event-consumer workflows with replay protection and robust permission change handling.
- Improved developer and release reliability through containerized environments, migration discipline, and cross-platform git normalization.
- Applied AI-assisted engineering practices for faster delivery, structured decision-making, and higher test coverage.

## Portfolio Website Blurb
I engineered RelayDocs as a production-minded full-stack system with secure collaboration workflows, strict data validation, asynchronous event processing, and CI-enforced quality gates. The project highlights both software architecture depth and practical AI-assisted engineering execution.
